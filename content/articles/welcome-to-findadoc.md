We recently celebrated our ✨**one-month**✨ mark of helping thousands of residents across Japan get COVID-19 vaccinations! I want to say thank you to everyone in the international community of Japan that has helped the project by submitting clinic information, translating, and helping to code the site.

There are big plans for Find a Doc in the near future. We're currently working on implementing a multilingual clinic database. What does that mean? It means that users will be able to search for healthcare services in their preferred language, and will be able to see how many doctors across Japan can speak it!

Find a Doc is an open-source project that relies entirely on support and donations from the community to run. If you have time, please hop over to our **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ourjapanlife/findadoc-frontend)** to see what ways you can contribute. Also, please consider leaving us a **[small donation](https://ko-fi.com/theyokohamalife)** 🙏🏾 to help out with the costs to keep the database running.

Thank you! 🙇🏾‍♀️
